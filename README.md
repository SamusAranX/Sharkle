# Sharkle
Hey!

## Features
* Believes in you
* Behaves just like in *Night in the Woods*

* Looks crisp even on those newfangled high-DPI screens (this might require Windows 10)

## Download
Download Sharkle over on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/SamusAranX/Sharkle/releases).

* At least Windows 7 with SP1
  * I recommend Windows 10 though, there's like zero reasons not to upgrade
  * *No, get outta here with that conspiracy crap*
